<!-- _# AIM : Given a receipt, the aim is to extract the domain specific fields by using deep-learning techinques. -->

# Goal

- Provide a end-to-end solution for information extraction from images.
- Achieve decent accuracy with very few annotated images.

# Development Plan

![](./docs/images/block-diagram.jpg)

The above diagram depicts the various 

- __Dataset__:

  - We use the dataset present on the [website](http://expressexpense.com/view-receipts.php).
    These are the receipts collected from various sources and are of various types.

- __Data Preparation__:

  - Web scrapping: scrapy 
  - We use the python library called scrapy in order to crawl and download all the images
  - we have around ~2k receipt images.
    ![](./docs/images/ReceiptSwiss.jpg)

- __Data Annotation__:

  - We annotate around 125 images using image annotation [tool](https://github.com/frederictost/images_annotation_programme). 
  - The information we are interested from the receipts are 
    - Merchant - name of the store
    - Receipt number - bill id
    - Date-  receipt issue date
    - Line items and their value - items in cart and their value
    - Total - final total value paid
    - Tax - tax calculated on line items
    - Mode of payment - card/cash
      ![](./docs/images/image-anno.png)

- __Object Detection__:

  - We leverage the existing pre-trained models for the detecting the above points of interest by using [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection)

- __Image Segmentation and Cropping__:

  - Following folder structure is adopted to output the images by croping the receipt image for predicted co-ordinates and labels

    ```
    image_name_1\
        label_1.jpg
        label_2.jpg
        label_3.jpg
     ...
    ```

- __OCR__: Tesseract. Converts the cropped images to text

  ```
  image_name_1\
      label_1.txt
      label_2.txt
      label_3.txt
  ...  
  ```

- __Text Postprocessing__: Domain specific 

  ```
  image_name_1.csv
  ...
  ```

# Round Two

## Introduction

In the previous experiments we found that the results were not up to the mark. So in this run we will try to improve on the accuracy of the system by tweaking individuals blocks of the pipeline.

## Dataset

Consists of 2k scrapped images images. We have the following statistics about the annotated images.

- 200 images tagged for receipt localization.
- 125 receipts tagged for 7 classes mentioned above.
- Script to generate dataset for region detection like merchant+logo, line items, tax. 
  - This scripts needs to be enriched with lot of augmentations so that we can add things like 
    - rotations
    - cropped regions
    - basically use ImgAug for getting a dataset generation as close to real world receipt image, failing to this would cause the trained model to perform badly on real world data.

## Steps Proposed

1. Assume r, a receipt which belongs to a set S.
2. for receipt in S:
   - perform receipt identification/localisation which detects exact position of receipt in the given image.
   - Detect the skewness/rotation. correct the skewness.
   - Detect/perform if perspective transformation is required.
   - Model to detect the various regions **Merchant+logo, Line items, Tax** .
   - For the above detected regions, model to hierarchically detect the items.
     - **Merchant+logo**
       - Merchant - name of the store.
       - Receipt number - bill id.
       - Date-  receipt issue date.
     - **Line items**,
       - Line items and their value - items in cart and their value.
     - **Tax** 
       - Total - final total value paid.
       - Tax - tax calculated on line items.
       - Mode of payment - card/cash.
   - Perform OCR.
   - Combine Output into CSV.
   - END: TO BE DECIDED.

## Things to make note of

- Try reducing the image size (preprocessed images to network like binarized or edge detected images).

- Mix the image from real world with generated by the scripts.

- CNN are better at detecting noise which is gaussian in nature, but will fail for image which are crumpled or having dog-ear.

- For detecting the receipt in a image, we can use the text detectors and form regions.

- Also thinking of using networks trained on tesseract features for extracting text/character from images.

## Receipt Image - Limitations

- Recept size width is atleast 350.
- Expected the images size are having no corner trademarks or Crop Image while annotation
